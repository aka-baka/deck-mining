If yes, this guide is for you, I will go through the tools and setup to enable you to extract and look up text in the game you're playing, and optionally create Anki cards with screenshots and audio (mining).</p> <p>If you're unfamiliar with the concept of immersion learning or Anki mining, here's a guide that goes through it.</p> <p>The bulk of this guide will be what I tried on default SteamOS. If you know a good workflow in gaming mode, do please share. I can only get these working nicely in desktop mode. I will also cover a little of my experience with dual-booting Windows on the Deck.</p> <p>If you're planning to go the Windows route (dual-boot/VM), the tips and controller section of the guide might still be helpful. Otherwise the tools are similar to Windows PC mining workflow which are shared in some other guides, for example Xelieu's Lazy Guide, or Donkuri's guide.</p> <p>If you are planning on playing a lot of VN's that are not Steam Deck certified or has native Linux supoprt, you might have to fiddle with some proton prefixes or install additional codecs to get them playing properly.

Steps below are for reference only of what I've tried. manga_ocr currently does not work due to missing xclip or wl-paste. It used to work but looks like some SteamOS update broke it. Also I'm having trouble installing owocr in a Python venv, but I need venv to install OCR services like Google Lens or EasyOCR, so I'm currently stuck.</p> Just for my reference, does not work  I'll be going through [OwOcr](https://github.com/AuroraWright/owocr) here. If you're comfortable with installing software through pacman, you can also check out YomiNinja.  ## Install OwOcr 1. Create a Python virtual env (need this for manga_ocr on the Steam Deck, or it'll complain about externally managed environment and possibility of breaking the OS if you try to override it). Open Konsole and type or paste in following: <pre><code>python3 -m venv ocr\nsource ocr/bin/activate\n</code></pre> 2. install pip  <pre><code>python -m ensurepip --upgrade\n</code></pre> This will install pip into ~/.local/bin. We need to add this to PATH as well.    3. edit `~/.bashrc` in something like `Kate` or `vim`, add this to the end of the file: <pre><code>if [ -d \"$HOME/.local/bin\" ]; then\n  PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"\nfi\n</code></pre> 4. Test it's working: <pre><code>~/.local/bin/pip -V\n</code></pre> 5. Now we can install owocr: <pre><code>pip install owocr\n</code></pre> 6. And install manga_ocr: <pre><code>pip install manga_ocr\n</code></pre> Reference: (https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/x4ct1r/how_do_i_do_a_pip3_install/)  ## Using OwOcr `To be added`  <p>Note: I did not manage to try it, but it may be possible to install python and the ocr tools properly through podman and/or distrobox without having to unlock the Deck and use pac-man.

I like to use between 110 - 150%.</li> <li>There are times (especially when setting up) where it'll be much easier if you have a keyboard and mouse. A few options:</li> <li>Use bluetooth kb+m</li> <li>Get a usb-c dock and connect your kb+m</li> <li>Remote desktop (either through Steam remote play or other software)</li> <li>window mode for games are more stable than fullscreen since we have to alt+tab often. Use frameless window option if the game supports it.</li> <li>back buttons are good candidates to map for our window switching, OCR, and mining actions</li> <li>map single click and moving the cursor to separate trackpads for easier click and drag (if you're attempting OCR where you have to drag a region)</li> <li>you can map double click by using extra command of type \"start press\" and put a delay</li> <li>disable mouse in the game if supported to avoid camera moving around or accidentally advancing text when grabbing a screenshot for OCR. Eg. Senpatcher for Sen no Kiseki can disable mouse in-game</li> </ul>"},{"location":"tips/#transferring-files","title":"Transferring files","text":"<p>Options:</p> <ul> <li>SFTP (eg, WinSCP or FileZilla on Windows) - recommended as it was the easiest for me.</li> <li>KDE Connect (only for small files, it fails for files larger than a couple of GB for me)</li> <li>Warpinator (failed a few times on me)</li> </ul> <p>Others I know of but didn't use:</p> <ul> <li>Syncthing</li> <li>sshfs</li> <li>deckMTP</li> <li>cloud services (eg, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc)</li> <li>USB drives or SD cards (note: some filesystem formats may not be recognized by Linux, or Windows)</li> </ul>"}]}
