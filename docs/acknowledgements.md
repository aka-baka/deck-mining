# Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the following people who made this guide possible:

- Xelieu who made the lazy guide which I based my Yomitan and mining setup on. Also thanks for introducing me to mkdocs and having the lazy guide page source code available for reference.
- xythh who I got the code to add screenshot and audio to Anki on Linux, I only needed to make minor edits to make them work on the Deck.
- Nerdnest (on YouTube) who made really good controller mapping tutorials and which I hope to learn and use more in the future.
- Visual Novel Wiki for the resources on getting VNs to work on Linux.
- TheMoeWay community, from which I first learnt about most of the tools involved and also gave some help when I had technical questions.

And you, dear reader who've made it to this page, thank you. I hope there's been something useful in here for you, and feel free to reach out if you'd like to contribute to the guide or share your experiences on Japanese learning with the Steam Deck.
