# Hooking Lutris or Other Proton Launcher Games

I assume you're familiar with how to get visual novels running using Lutris or Bottles. If not, you can refer to [Visual Novel wiki](https://www.visualnovelwiki.org/en/home). The site has good instructions on setting up wineprefixes as well as having a [VN compatibility list](https://www.visualnovelwiki.org/en/vns) with what prefixes work for them.

If you're unfamiliar with wine/proton, a very simple way to think of it (not very accurate, but good enough for our usage) is having mini virtual Windows PC on every "wine/proton prefix".  

So the challenge is to ensure Textractor or Agent will launch in the same prefix (mini virtual Windows PC), or it won't be able to find your game.  
**As long as you have a working prefix for your game, you can use the same prefix to launch Textractor or Agent, and everything else will work the same like hooking a Steam game.**

Note: if the VN wiki is bugging out and not displaying images, you can check [archived pages at the Internet Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20230630100108/https://www.visualnovelwiki.org/en/home) instead.
