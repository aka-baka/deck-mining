# Setup Introduction

Unless otherwise specified, all the setup and usage will be in SteamOS **desktop mode**. To make things simple, I'll stick to using either flatpaks from the Discover app, appimages, or software that are easily installed with scripts.

There are a few components to the gaming immersion flow:

1. the game itself
2. a tool to extract text from the game as you play (Textractor/Agent/OCR tools etc)
3. something to display the extracted text (typically in a browser)
4. something to look up the vocab in a dictionary
5. (optional) mine to Anki (optionally saving screenshots and audio too) for revision study later

## Starting setup

If you're in gaming mode, switch over to desktop mode. (Press the `Steam` button -> `power` -> `switch to desktop mode`)

Follow the steps in the next sections. If you're not planning on mining to Anki, you can follow the steps to texthook/OCR and Yomitan, and ignore the parts about Anki and Ankiconnect.
