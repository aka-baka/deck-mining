# Controller config

Please learn how to change the controller config of games in Steam separately, I won't be covering that in this guide.

## Desktop vs game config

Game configs are per-game, and are active when the game is in focus.

Desktop config is active when the game is *not* in focus.

As such, you'll want to ensure Alt+Tab is mapped for both configs, otherwise you may be able to tab away from the game but not back, or vice-versa.

## Tips

For some reason left Alt+Tab doesn't work for me to tab away from game. But Right Alt+Tab does.
Personally I map Right Alt to L4, and Tab to R4. This way, I can keep holding Alt while tabbing a few times to swap between multiple windows, instead of just toggling between the 2 most recent.

If you're using SteamTinkerLaunch, you'll want to ensure something (I suggest touchpad) is mapped to mouse movement and click in the game config so that you can click on the menu.

Steam + x will bring up the on-screen keyboard.

For VNs, you'll likely want to map these actions if it's not already in your config:

- replay audio
- bring up backlog
- quick save, quick load

## Templates

(WIP) It should be possible to save a config as a template to make it easier to set up for other games, but I have not done this yet.

## Advanced mappings

Examples of more fancy things you can do:

- set up different layers so the same button does different things when another button or the touchpad is pressed.
- create radial menus with the touchpad or stick
- create button menus with the touchpad

These are useful if the game you're playing is already using the majority of buttons and you want to map more actions for Anki mining.

You can learn more from video tutorials, eg. [NerdNest's excellent one on action layers](https://youtu.be/nEh79r93vYY).
