## Introduction

Are you learning Japanese and own a Steam Deck? Do you want to do look up words easily while playing Japanese games on it? If yes, this guide is for you, I will go through the tools and setup to enable you to extract and look up text in the game you're playing, and optionally create Anki cards with screenshots and audio (mining).

If you're unfamiliar with the concept of immersion learning or Anki mining, here's a [guide](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese) that goes through it.

The bulk of this guide will be what I tried on default SteamOS. If you know a good workflow in gaming mode, do please share. I can only get these working nicely in desktop mode.
I will also cover a little of my experience with dual-booting Windows on the Deck.

If you're planning to go the Windows route (dual-boot/VM), the tips and controller section of the guide might still be helpful. Otherwise the tools are similar to Windows PC mining workflow which are shared in some other guides, for example [Xelieu's Lazy Guide](https://xelieu.github.io/jp-lazy-guide/setup/), or [Donkuri's guide](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/).

If you are planning on playing a lot of VN's that are not Steam Deck certified or has native Linux supoprt, you might have to fiddle with some proton prefixes or install additional codecs to get them playing properly. If you don't have the patience to figure out these technical details for each game, you might want to consider using Windows - see [Running Windows on the Steam Deck](runWin.md) for more info.

## Guide structure

This guide will go through:

- tools setup (you can choose to install only those you need)
- demos
- controller config and other Steam Deck tips
- extras (Windows, other resources)

Note: I will focus only on games and not cover other aspects of immersion learning such as reading novels or manga or watching anime in this guide. (I prefer to consume those media on other devices.)

If you want to use the Steam Deck for those, I believe the Linux workflows for mining those should work as well, just refer to the guides linked earlier.
