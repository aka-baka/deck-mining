Still a draft.

## Introduction

Note: If you are planning on playing a lot of VN's that is not Steam Deck certified or native Linux, you might want to consider using Windows, check out dual-booting Windows. Or using a virtual machine. It'll save you fiddling with a lot of settings. Check out [Running Windows on the Steam Deck](runWin.md) for more info.

On that note, the bulk of this guide will be what I tried on default SteamOS. If you're planning to go the Windows route, the tips and controller section of the guide might still be helpful.
