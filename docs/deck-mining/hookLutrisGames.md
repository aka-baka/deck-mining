# Hooking Lutris or Other Proton Launcher Games
I assume you're familiar with how to get visual novels running using Lutris or Bottles. I personally refer to [Visual Novel wiki](https://www.visualnovelwiki.org/en/home).  
If you're unfamiliar with wine/proton, a very simple (and not very accurate, but good enough for our usage) way to think of it is having mini virtual Windows PC on every "wine/proton prefix".  
So the challenge is to ensure Textractor or Agent will launch in the same prefix (mini virtual Windows PC), or it won't be able to find your game.  
As long as you have a working prefix for your game, you can use the same prefix to launch Textractor or Agent, and everything else will work the same like hooking a Steam game.


Note: unfortunately the VN wiki is bugging out and not displaying images as of the time of this writing, so you might want to check [archived pages at the Internet Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20241001000000*/www.visualnovelwiki.org) instead.
