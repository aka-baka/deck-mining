# Setup Introduction

Unless otherwise specified, all the setup and usage will be in desktop mode. To make things simple, I'll stick to using either flatpaks from the Discover app, or software that do not need installation. (except Emudeck, but that has a script that handles everything.)

## Gaming mode -> desktop mode

Press the "Steam" button -> power -> switch to desktop mode

## Desktop mode -> gaming mode

Double click the "Back to gaming mode" shortcut on desktop

## Starting setup

Switch over to desktop mode, and follow the steps in the next sections. Basic setup tools are a must; for the rest, you can pick only the ones you use. If you're not planning on mining to Anki, you can follow the steps to extract text/OCR and ignore the parts about Anki and Ankiconnect.
