# Setup Introduction

Unless otherwise specified, all the setup and usage will be in desktop mode. To make things simple, I'll stick to using either flatpaks from the Discover app, or software that are easily installed with scripts.

There are a few components to the gaming immersion flow:

1. the game itself (obviously)
2. a tool to extract text from the game as you play (Textractor/Agent/OCR tools etc)
3. something to display the extracted text (typically in a browser)
4. something to look up the vocab in a dictionary (or a few of them at once)
5. (optional) mine to Anki (including saving screenshots and audio) for revision study later

## Starting setup

If you're in gaming mode, switch over to desktop mode. (Press the "Steam" button -> power -> switch to desktop mode)

Follow the steps in the next sections. Basic tools are a must; for the rest, you can pick only the ones you use. If you're not planning on mining to Anki, you can follow the steps to extract text/OCR and ignore the parts about Anki and Ankiconnect.
