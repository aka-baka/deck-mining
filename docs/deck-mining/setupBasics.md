# Tools

## To extract text as you play the game
(if you know what the game needs, you can just get that, or grab them all to be well-prepared)

- Textractor
- Agent
- owocr (or Yomininja if you know what you're doing with pacman)
- something for OCR, I suggest owocr. Yomininja is also promising if you're willing to muck around with pacman to install it (I do not want to risk breaking SteamOS in the case of conflicting dependencies so I've not done this)

## To display and look up text:
- a browser that supports Yomitan extension(eg, Firefox, Chrome, Chromium browsers)
- Yomitan extension
- a browser texthook page

## To mine vocab to Anki:
- Anki
- Ankiconnect browser extension

## Optional: offline and more audio sources for Yomitan
