# Hooking Linux Games or Emulators

This is the most straightforward if Agent supports the game you want to hook. Just launch your game, then launch Agent yourself.  

For emulators, I've only tested Yuzu. Linux version of Agent works with it. (Now that Yuzu has been taken down, you can either try to get an AppImage from a reputable source, or use Ryujinx, as Agent now supports it.)
If you've tried other emulators, let me know your experience!

I don't think Textractor supports native Linux so I doubt it can hook any emulator running with native Linux. (It can if it's running under wine/proton).
If none of the texthook tools work, it's time to try OCR. (covered in the next section)
