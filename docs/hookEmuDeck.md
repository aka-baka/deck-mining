# Hooking Linux Games or Emulators
This is the most straightforward. Just launch your game, then launch Textractor or Agent yourself.  
For emulators, I've only tested Yuzu. Linux version of Agent works with it.  
I have not tried other emulators, not sure if Agent or Textractor would be able to work with them. (If you've tried, let me know your experience!)
