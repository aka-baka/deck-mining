# Running Windows on the Steam Deck
For when something really cannot work in Linux, or you're lazy to fiddle around with Lutris/Bottle/proton settings to get a VN working. Or if a texthook only seems to work in Windows (Trails of Cold Steel Agent hook, for example). 

There are a few options:
1. in SteamOS, run Windows as a virtual machine (using Boxes for example)
2. dual-boot Windows from a SD card. Recommended if you're testing only and not for long-term use, as there's a high likelihood the SD card will fail earlier.
Also the performance is going to be bad for games in general.
3. dual-boot Windows from the internal SSD (or an external SSD). This is the option I recommend. Follow this guide: [Bald Sealion's Steam Deck Ultimate Windows Guide](https://baldsealion.com/Steam-Deck-Ultimate-Windows-Guide/index.html)

# Tools on Windows
There are some tools I did not recommend in the main guide as the installation is a pain in Linux. If you're using Windows, you can consider using these tools:
1. [YomiNinja](https://github.com/matt-m-o/YomiNinja) for OCR
2. [JL](https://github.com/rampaa/JL) as an alternative to texthook pages. This overlays the text directly on top of the game window.
Limitation: it supports mining to Anki, but not handlebars so you might not be able to use fancy Anki card templates that you use with Yomitan on a browser.
3. [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) is an essential tool, you can get screenshots and record audio easily.
