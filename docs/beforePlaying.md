# Getting Things Ready Before Playing

Make sure your desktop controller mappings support Alt-Tab, and optionally hotkeys to save cards, screenshots and audio to Anki. (only need to do this once. See the section on [controller mapping](controller.md) for more details.)
Also configure the game controller mapping to include Alt-Tab, and optionally trackpad for mouse move and clicks. Also optionally hotkeys to save screenshots and record audio to Anki. (Need to do per-game in Steam)

Things you will want to launch every time you want to do immersion learning gaming:

1. Browser and texthook page. Make sure Yomitan is enabled
2. Anki (if you're mining, or using offline audio with it)

I personally just launch everything manually myself, but you could write a short bash script to start them all if you want.

It's time to then launch the game and hook it. Follow the relevant parts in the following sections, you'll only need to do one type of hooking for a game.
